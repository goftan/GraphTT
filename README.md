# GTea
GTea is an online version of GraphTea (www.graphtheorysoftware.com/).
GraphTea is an open source software, 
crafted for high quality standards and released under GPL license. 
You can find more details about the source code and issue tracket on Github.
It is a perfect tool for Students, Teachers, Researchers, Game Developers and much more. 

The idea is to have a Java server which recieves the requests from server and pass them to GraphTea model.
The results, which can be a graph or any number or string, are packed into a JSON and are sent back to JS client.
The JS client, which is written completely new, handle the recieved JSON based on the selected actions.

There are several publications using GTea which can be found in my website (https://rostam.github.io/). 

Is it temporarily hosted under http://csc.inf-ra.uni-jena.de/server/index.html.
